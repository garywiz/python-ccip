# python-ccip
Python Reference version of Container Configuration and Introspection Protocol (CCIP)

This repository is reserved for work on the definition and reference implementation of CCIP.  All specifications are currently being written and [are located in the Wiki](https://github.com/garywiz/python-ccip/wiki) associated with this repo.

Contributions are welcome.  However, avoid modifying the specifications is some discussion in [the Issues section](https://github.com/garywiz/python-ccip/issues) would be a better starting point.
